When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I use a remote repository when I want to safe my progress in the cloud. This could be useful when I want to access my files from anoter computer, collaborate with another person, or safe my progress online in case my hard drive breaks.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to pull and push manually because I might want to try something on my local computer without affecting the version of my repository that I keep online. If I fuck up something locally there is still a backup online.
