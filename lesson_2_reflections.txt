What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A repository without any commit is created. There are no files in the repository yet. The files need to be added using git add <file>.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a space between the working directory and the repository. It is like a storage that can contain multiple files. That is the beauty about the staiging area. It allows you to commit changes in multipe files at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I don't understand the question. Probably, it aims at pointing out that zou can add several files to the staging area at once before making a commit. So logical changes that stretch over a series of files can be committed via the staging area. 
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when I want to work on two different versions of one and the same program. A branch allows me to create a new line of commits that differ from the master branch.
